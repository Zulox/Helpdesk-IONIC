## Front End

IONIC use AngularJS

the main code can be found in the "www" folder

## Back End

The app utilize PHP as backed

the main backend code can be found in the "API" folder


#---CAUTION---, repo is for code demo only

Due to the restriction of development experience and resource, the database did not deployed in the web thus the database only exist in my local machine

the database url in the app are also hardcoded thus making it difficult for you to actually build the app in your machine and test

even if you install the APK (Zulox.Apk) into your phone it wont work,

HOWEVER!! you could if you download WAMP and put the 'API' folder into your 'www' folder and make a database named "mobiradeon" and import the 'mobiradeon.sql' data into it ( located inside the API folder)


BUT!!, lets get real, i doubt anyone would attempt this, or even read this LOL
